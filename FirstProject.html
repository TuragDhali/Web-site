        The teacher I love & admire the most is Mam Molly Mehta. She is our Science teacher. She is very beautiful. She has big height and big eyes. She has inner beauty too. She is a perfect example of an ideal teacher.Apart from school books she also teaches us many useful things in life. I discuss my personal problems with her like many othstudentShe has answers to all the problems.Her teaching methods are 
        We do not need to learn the answers. They way she teaches us make us understand the answers so that we can write them in our own words instead of learning. She has that power which draws everybodyâ€™s attention to what she is teaching. She believes in practical way of studying. So she conducts live experiments to various subjects to make us understand how it goes in real life.<br/> <br/>
        We see many animals. Some are wild and some are domestic. The cow is a domestic animal. Of all the domestic animals, the cow is the most useful. The cow has four legs. She has a long head with two eyes, two ears and two horns. She has a long tail with a tuft of hair at the end. She drives away flies and mosquitoes with her tail. She has one set of teeth in her lower jaw. Her body covered with short hair. She defends herself with the help of her horns. Her hoofs are divided. The cow is found almost everywhere in the world. Wild cows live in jungles. There are many kinds of cows. Some are big and some are small. The cows of cold countries are big some cows are black, some are red, some are big and some are of mixed colors. The cow is gentle and it does no harm to us. She gives birth to one calf at a time. She eats all day long and chews the cud. She loves her calf very much. The cow lives on grass. She eats straw, bran, and leaves of trees. It also eats oil cakes. The cow is very useful to us. Her milk is sweet and nutritious. Many kinds of sweets are made from milk bags and shoes are made of her hide. Buttons and combs are made of bones. Cow-dung is good manure. The cow does much good to us. So we should take of her.  </p>
